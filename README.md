A simple code for Multple Signal Classification (MUSIC). 
Input arguments are as follows:
YY = Signal snapshots (including AWGN noise)
ZC = Parameter space matrix (In case of DoA Estimation, ZC is the set of array steering vector)
u = Number of features (In case of DoA Estimation, u is the number of complex sinusoids)
